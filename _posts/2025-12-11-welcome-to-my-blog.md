## Hello World! 🚀

Welcome to **willburnstech** — my corner of the internet where I document my journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

I'm Will, a Full-Stack AI Engineer, Computer Science student, and founder of AutomateWise. This blog is where I'll be sharing:

- **AI Engineering** — Practical implementations, LLM patterns, and automation workflows
- **Security Research** — Penetration testing insights, CTF writeups, and vulnerability analysis
- **Full-Stack Development** — Building modern web applications with Next.js, Python, and more

## Why Start a Blog?

In the AI revolution we're living through, I believe it's more important than ever to:

1. **Document and share knowledge** — The best way to learn is to teach
2. **Build in public** — Show the process, not just the polished results
3. **Connect with the community** — Find like-minded builders and security researchers

## What to Expect

### Technical Deep-Dives

I'll be writing detailed tutorials and breakdowns on topics like:

- Building RAG systems with LangChain and vector databases
- Setting up AI agents with tool use and memory
- Security testing methodologies and tools
- Full-stack architecture patterns

### Project Walkthroughs

Expect posts covering real projects I'm working on:

- **TaxGuru AI** — An AI research assistant for accountants
- **AutomateWise** — AI chatbots, voice agents, and workflow automations
- Various security research and CTF challenges

### Code & Examples

Every technical post will include working code examples. Here's a taste of what's to come:

```python
# A simple example of what we'll be building
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful AI assistant."),
    ("user", "{input}")
])

chain = prompt | llm
response = chain.invoke({"input": "What can you help me with?"})
```
